%%%%% SECTION: fertilizersDescription
%%%%% Put a brief description of your program below

My program solves a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) involving 5 plants, each fertilized
with a different type of fertilizer. The goal is to determine which fertilizer was used for
each plant, based on their heights, tomato yields, and weights, while satisfying all given constraints.
To reduce the number of variables, I will define the fertilizers as variables with their domain set to the plant numbers.

The constraints involve relational information about the plants, such as heights (distinct values),
tomato yields, and weights, as well as specific conditions about the fertilizers (e.g., 
"the tallest plant is fertilized with seaweed," "the heaviest plant is fertilized with egg-shells").
The program employs interleaved constraint propagation, starting with height constraints (as they
prune the search space the most), followed by yields, weights, and fertilizer assignments.

The program uses myAllDiff predicate to ensure the uniqueness of heights, yields, weights,
and fertilizer assignments across all plants (implicit constraints).

Querying the program using solve(List) to verify the solution list of plants:
?- solve([Bone_meal, Compost, Egg_shells, Manure, Seaweed, H1, T1, W1, H2, T2, W2, H3, T3, W3, H4, T4, W4, H5, T5, W5]).

Bone_meal = 1
Compost = 3
Egg_shells = 4
Manure = 5
Seaweed = 2

T1 = 12
W1 = 3
H2 = 7
T2 = 4
W2 = 9
H3 = 1
T3 = 9
W3 = 10

H5 = 4
T5 = 21
W5 = 14


Querying the program using solve_and_print (no arguments) to display detailed information:

Yes

Bone-meal is used to fertilize plant 1.
Compost is used to fertilize plant 3.
Egg-shells is used to fertilize plant 4.
Manure is used to fertilize plant 5.
Seaweed is used to fertilize plant 2.

Plant 1 is 2 feet tall, yields 12 tomatoes, weighing 3 pounds.
Plant 2 is 7 feet tall, yields 4 tomatoes, weighing 9 pounds.
Plant 3 is 1 feet tall, yields 9 tomatoes, weighing 10 pounds.
Plant 4 is 5 feet tall, yields 6 tomatoes, weighing 19 pounds.
Plant 5 is 4 feet tall, yields 21 tomatoes, weighing 14 pounds.
